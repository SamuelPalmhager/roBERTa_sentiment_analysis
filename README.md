# roBERTa_sentiment_analysis
Hello!
This is my sentiment analysis project using a machine learning approach by using the roBERTa transformer model on an amazon review dataset. The objectives for this project is the following:

  - Gain some understanding for working with transformer models.
  - Further develop my skills working with common python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib and numpy. 
  - Practice my skills in exploratory data analysis. 

For this project we will be downloading and using the "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment" roBERTa, which is a commonly used transformer model that is trained on twitter data. 

Conclusions from project:
  - The project worked well with the downloaded BERT-model and was able to derive fitting conclusions for each review.  
  - The way of calculating a score, based on the polarity scores, using linear regression proved succesful, if one is to want a     more precise predicting then more data is to be fitted.
